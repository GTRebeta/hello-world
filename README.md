The repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Gannon Rebeta. Right now, I'm in my second week of my Summer I Software Engineering course of 2024. The coursework is starting to look a lot more intimidating. I have a hard time concentrating, so I tend to work slower - made worse by the fact that I often give up under stress and dwell on my past mistakes. This semester is incredibly important to my life and future, so I hope everything goes well.
